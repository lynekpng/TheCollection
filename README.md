This is my version of the exercise "The Collection" accessible via https://lynekpng.github.io/TheCollection/ 		
	In this project I had to use my fresh knowledge of HTML, CSS, SCSS, and Javascript to create a collection of cards on a chosen subject. We had to do so by generating the HTML document using the DOM method.
	I enjoy and listen to music on a daily basis so that's what i naturally gravitated to.
